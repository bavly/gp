# Our Graduation project in field of Big data analytics and Mobile development 



Problem:
 Currently, dedicated employees are assigned the responsibility of passing by all buildings in all regions to read the electricity meter device, record consumption, and to collect bills' payment. This requires the physical presence of the
proprietor in order to permit the entrance of the employee to get the readings and collect payments. However, most people are at work during daylight.


In
 this project, we investigate to read usage meters through a smart device by capturing a picture for it and extract the content into usage
numbers
value. The extracted output should be encrypted in a certain way before transmitting it to the server, where it authenticates the sender identity and can allow to proceed with a payment process.
 On the server side, big data analytics will be considered in order to analyze individuals' consumption for usage prediction and performance improvement.
